Grades

Faculty/Staff Comments

Uses a color-coded alert system to indicate student well-being:

ðŸŸ¥ Red â€“ Immediate attention recommended

ðŸŸ¨ Yellow â€“ Warning, suggest outreach

ðŸŸ© Green â€“ No issues detected

Faculty can input observations and updates for a more holistic view.

Development:
Built with C# in Visual Studio

Purpose:
The goal is to provide an early warning system for student mental health challenges by combining academic performance and behavioral feedback in a centralized tool.
